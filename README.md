# Floyd's Recursive Algorithm

This Python script (Floyd_Algorithm_Rewrite.py) implements Floyd's algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph. The implementation uses a recursive approach with PEP standard.

## Overview

Floyd's algorithm is a classic algorithm for solving the all-pairs shortest path problem in a weighted, directed graph. This recursive implementation demonstrates the fundamental idea of the algorithm.

## Performance test

The Performance Floyd_Algorithm_Performance_test.py script demonstrates the execution time of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for a larger graph.

## Unit test
The Floyd_Algorithm_Unit_test.py script demonstrates the unit test for each function of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm
